## Core Protocol

**SPEC → PLAN → EXECUTE → VERIFY → COMMIT**

1. **SPEC**: Define requirements in `.gsd/SPEC.md` until status is `FINALIZED`
2. **PLAN**: Decompose into phases in `.gsd/ROADMAP.md`, then detailed plans
3. **EXECUTE**: Implement with atomic commits per task
4. **VERIFY**: Prove completion with empirical evidence
5. **COMMIT**: One task = one commit, message format: `type(scope): description`

**Planning Lock**: No implementation code until SPEC.md contains "Status: FINALIZED".

---

## Proof Requirements

Every change requires verification evidence:

| Change Type | Required Proof |
|-------------|----------------|
| API endpoint | curl/HTTP response |
| UI change | Screenshot |
| Build/compile | Command output |
| Test | Test runner output |
| Config | Verification command |

**Never accept**: "It looks correct", "This should work", "I've done similar before".

**Always require**: Captured output, screenshot, or test result.

---

## Search-First Discipline

**Before reading any file completely:**

1. **Search first** — Use grep, ripgrep, or IDE search to find relevant snippets
2. **Evaluate snippets** — Determine if full file read is justified
3. **Targeted reads** — Only read specific line ranges when needed

**Benefits:**
- Reduces context pollution
- Faster understanding of large codebases
- Prevents reading irrelevant code

**Anti-pattern**: Reading entire files "to understand the context" without searching first.

---

## Wave Execution

Plans are grouped into **waves** based on dependencies:

| Wave | Characteristic | Execution |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | Foundation tasks, no dependencies | Run in parallel |
| 2 | Depends on Wave 1 | Wait for Wave 1, then parallel |
| 3 | Depends on Wave 2 | Wait for Wave 2, then parallel |

**Wave Completion Protocol:**
1. All tasks in wave verified
2. State snapshot created
3. Commit all wave work
4. Update STATE.md with position

---

## State Snapshots

At the end of each wave or significant work block, create a state snapshot:

```markdown
## Wave N Summary

**Objective:** {what this wave aimed to accomplish}

**Changes:**
- {change 1}
- {change 2}

**Files Touched:**
- {file1}
- {file2}

**Verification:**
- {command}: {result}

**Risks/Debt:**
- {any concerns}

**Next Wave TODO:**
- {item 1}
- {item 2}
```

---

## Model Independence

**Absolute Rule**: No rule, workflow, or skill may require a specific model provider.

**Allowed:**
- Optional adapters with provider-specific enhancements
- Capability-based recommendations (e.g., "use a reasoning model for planning")
- Examples mentioning specific models as illustrations

**Forbidden:**
- Hard dependencies on provider features
- Breaking behavior when a specific model is unavailable
- Duplicating canonical rules in adapters

**Adapter Pattern:**
```
adapters/
├── CLAUDE.md    # Optional Claude enhancements
├── GEMINI.md    # Optional Gemini enhancements
└── GPT_OSS.md   # Optional GPT/OSS enhancements
```

Each adapter must begin with:
> "Everything in this file is optional. For canonical rules, see PROJECT_RULES.md."

---

## Commit Conventions

**Format:**
```
type(scope): description
```

**Types:**
| Type | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `refactor` | Code restructure (no behavior change) |
| `test` | Adding/updating tests |
| `chore` | Maintenance, dependencies |

**Rules:**
- One task = one commit
- Verify before commit
- Scope = phase number for phase work (e.g., `feat(phase-1): ...`)

## Context Management

**Context Quality Thresholds:**

| Usage | Quality |
|-------|---------|
| 0-30% | **PEAK** — Comprehensive, thorough work |
| 30-50% | **GOOD** — Solid, confident output |
| 50-70% | **DEGRADING** — Efficiency mode |
| 70%+ | **POOR** — Rushed, incomplete |

**Context Hygiene Rules:**
- Keep plans under 50% context usage
- Fresh context for each plan execution
- After 3 debugging failures → state dump → fresh session
- STATE.md = memory across sessions

---

## Token Efficiency Rules

**Goal:** Minimize token consumption while maintaining output quality.

### Loading Rules

| Action | Rule |
|--------|------|
| Before reading file | Search first (grep, ripgrep) |
| File >200 lines | Use outline, not full file |
| File already understood | Reference summary, don't reload |
| >5 files needed | Stop, reconsider approach |

### Budget Thresholds

| Usage | Action Required |
|-------|-----------------|
| 0-50% | Proceed normally |
| 50-70% | Switch to outline mode, compress context |
| 70%+ | State dump required, recommend fresh session |

### Compression Protocol

After understanding a file:
1. Create summary in STATE.md or task notes
2. Reference summary instead of re-reading
3. Only reload specific sections if needed

### Per-Wave Efficiency

- Start each wave with minimal context
- Load files just-in-time (when task requires)
- Compress/summarize before moving to next wave
- Document token usage in state snapshots (optional)

**Anti-patterns:**
- Loading files "just in case"
- Re-reading files already understood
- Full file reads when snippets suffice
- Ignoring budget warnings

---

## Quick Reference

```
Before coding    → SPEC.md must be FINALIZED
Before file read → Search first, then targeted read
After each task  → Commit + update STATE.md
After each wave  → State snapshot
After 3 failures → State dump + fresh session
Before "Done"    → Empirical proof captured
```
