# Plan 1.3: Verification & Performance Baseline

## Objective
Prove the stability and performance of the WebView ZK engine against the product requirements.

## Context
- .gsd/SPEC.md
- zero-auth-wallet/lib/proof.ts

## Tasks

<task type="auto">
  <name>Baseline Proof Generation</name>
  <files>
    - zero-auth-wallet/scripts/verify-proof.ts
  </files>
  <action>
    - Execute a full "Verify Age" flow in Expo Go on a real device or emulator.
    - Measure the time from "Button Press" to "Proof Received".
    - Log the memory usage markers to ensure no OOM spikes.
  </action>
  <verify>Performance logs in console</verify>
  <done>Total proof generation time is < 3s.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>End-to-End Auth Verification</name>
  <files>
    - .gsd/VERIFICATION.md
  </files>
  <action>
    - Connect Wallet to a running Relay instance.
    - Complete a full QR -> Proof -> Auth Success cycle.
    - Document the result in `VERIFICATION.md`.
  </action>
  <verify>Relay log shows 'Proof Verified: True'</verify>
  <done>Relay accepts the proof generated by the WebView.</done>
</task>

## Success Criteria
- [ ] End-to-end auth takes < 5s.
- [ ] Proofs are cryptographically valid (Verified by Relay).
