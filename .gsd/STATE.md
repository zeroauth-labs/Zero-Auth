## Project Context
Zero Auth is a ZK-based passwordless authentication system. The project is in a brownfield state with three core components already initialized: Wallet, Relay, and SDK.

## Current Milestone: v1.0 — MVP Initialization
**Status**: 🔵 In Progress

- **Phase**: Phase 5: SDK Refinement & Production Prep (completed)
- **Task**: All tasks complete
- **Status**: 🟢 Verified

## Last Session Summary
- Refactored SDK for resilient polling with backoff and cancellation.
- Implemented in-memory asset caching in the wallet.
- Added background session cleanup to the Relay.

## Next Steps
1. `/plan 6` for Native Performance (Tech Pivot).

## Active Decisions
- Use `snarkjs` / `circomlibjs` for ZK logic across the stack.
- Multi-component project structure (Mono-repo style).
