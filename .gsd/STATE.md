## Project Context
Zero Auth is a ZK-based passwordless authentication system. The project is in a brownfield state with three core components already initialized: Wallet, Relay, and SDK.

## Current Milestone: v1.0 — MVP Initialization
**Status**: 🔵 In Progress

- **Phase**: Phase 3: Session Management & Revocation
- **Task**: Planning complete (Plans 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 formulated)
- **Status**: Ready for execution

## Last Session Summary
- Established WebView ZK Bridge (Phase 1).
- Implemented async verification and JSON import (Phase 2).
- Verified data integrity and performance targets.

## Next Steps
1. `/plan 3` to design Session Management and Revocation logic.

## Active Decisions
- Use `snarkjs` / `circomlibjs` for ZK logic across the stack.
- Multi-component project structure (Mono-repo style).
