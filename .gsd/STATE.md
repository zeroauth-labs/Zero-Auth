# Project State

> Auto-generated by /map on 2026-02-15

## Project Context
Zero Auth is a ZK-based passwordless authentication system. The project is in a brownfield state with three core components already initialized: Wallet, Relay, and SDK.

## Current Status: Stabilization & Demo Prep
**Status**: 🔵 In Progress

- **Phase**: Phase 7: ZK Generation Overhaul
- **Status**: 🟢 Core logic verified; 🟡 Network reachability issues on physical devices.

## Last Session Summary
- Implemented **WebView ZK Bridge (v7)** with `poseidon-lite` support, bypassing Hermes WASM limits.
- Added **Public URL Resolution** in the Relay to support physical mobile devices via tunnels.
- Added **CORS & Tunnel Bypass Headers** in the SDK for Localtunnel/ngrok compatibility.

## Next Steps
1. Implement **Mock Demo Mode** in the SDK to bypass network reliability issues for the presentation.
2. Finalize verification of the full end-to-end flow with the new tunnel configuration.

## Active Decisions
- Use `react-native-webview` for the ZK execution sandbox.
- Use `PUBLIC_URL` and `bypass-tunnel-reminder` headers to handle mobile NAT/hotspot firewalls.
- Create a "Mock" fallback in the SDK for demo stability.
