## Project Context
Zero Auth is a ZK-based passwordless authentication system. The project is in a brownfield state with three core components already initialized: Wallet, Relay, and SDK.

## Current Milestone: v1.0 — MVP Initialization
**Status**: 🔵 In Progress

- **Phase**: Phase 4: Extended Claims & Verification
- **Task**: Planning complete (Plans 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 formulated)
- **Status**: Active (resumed 2026-02-16T09:35:45Z)

## Last Session Summary
- Implemented real-time session revocation (Relay + Wallet).
- Built a session dashboard ("Privacy Monitor") in the wallet.
- Updated SDK to handle revoked signals gracefully.

## Next Steps
1. `/plan 4` to design Extended Claims & Identity Verification.

## Active Decisions
- Use `snarkjs` / `circomlibjs` for ZK logic across the stack.
- Multi-component project structure (Mono-repo style).
