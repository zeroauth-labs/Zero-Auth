## Project Context
Zero Auth is a ZK-based passwordless authentication system. The project is in a brownfield state with three core components already initialized: Wallet, Relay, and SDK.

## Current Milestone: v1.0 — MVP Initialization
**Status**: 🔵 In Progress

## Last Session Summary
- Reset codebase to commit `c15959a`.
- Performed codebase mapping (`/map`).
- Created `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `STACK.md`.
- Identified technical debt in Poseidon hashing and WebAssembly support in React Native.

## TODO for Next Session
- Create `SPEC.md` based on the latest user vision.
- Decompose requirements into executable phases in `ROADMAP.md`.
- Resolve the hashing stability issue in the wallet (Phase 12 in legacy task list).

## Active Decisions
- Use `snarkjs` / `circomlibjs` for ZK logic across the stack.
- Multi-component project structure (Mono-repo style).
