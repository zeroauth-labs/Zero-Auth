# Project State

> Auto-generated by /map on 2026-02-15

## Project Context
Zero Auth is a ZK-based passwordless authentication system. The project is in a brownfield state with three core components already initialized: Wallet, Relay, and SDK.

## Current Status: Demo Ready
**Status**: 🟢 Stable

- **Phase**: Phase 8: System Stabilization
- **Status**: ✅ All systems verified with physical devices via Ngrok.

## Last Session Summary
- Refactored **Relay** to separate Network/Session services.
- Refactored **SDK** for robust error handling and Ngrok compatibility.
- Verified **End-to-End Flow** with physical Android device and Ngrok tunnel.
- Created comprehensive **README.md** with setup instructions.

## Next Steps
1.  **Demo**: Use the system for the presentation.
2.  **Maintenance**: Monitor Ngrok tunnel stability during demos.

## Active Decisions
- Use `react-native-webview` for the ZK execution sandbox.
- Use `PUBLIC_URL` and `bypass-tunnel-reminder` headers to handle mobile NAT/hotspot firewalls.
- **Protocol Handling**: Relay intelligently handles `http/https` prefixes to avoid double-protocol errors.
