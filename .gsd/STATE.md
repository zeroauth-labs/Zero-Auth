## Project Context
Zero Auth is a ZK-based passwordless authentication system. The project is in a brownfield state with three core components already initialized: Wallet, Relay, and SDK.

## Current Milestone: v1.0 — MVP Initialization
**Status**: 🔵 In Progress

- **Phase**: Phase 4: Extended Claims & Verification (completed)
- **Task**: All tasks complete
- **Status**: 🟢 Verified

## Last Session Summary
- Implemented Student Status ZK circuit and assets.
- Built dynamic multi-circuit support in Wallet and Relay.
- Expanded SDK to support custom credential types.

## Next Steps
1. `/plan 5` to optimize asset loading for Expo Go.

## Active Decisions
- Use `snarkjs` / `circomlibjs` for ZK logic across the stack.
- Multi-component project structure (Mono-repo style).
